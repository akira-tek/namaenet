# NamaeNet

This repository contains my small project - NamaeNet.

NamaeNet is a Transformer-based model architecture. The basic Transformer modules are implemented by hand (MultiHeadAttention, FeedForward and so on).
It generates names based on the ones it's seen before (which means the `names.txt` file can be altered to fit your preference).

I'll be updating it gradually.
