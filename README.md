# NamaeNet

This repository contains my small project - NamaeNet.

NamaeNet is a Transformer-based model architecture.
It generates names based on the ones it's seen before (which means the `names.txt` file can be altered to fit your preference).
The basic Transformer modules are implemented by hand (MultiHeadAttention, FeedForward and so on).

I'll be updating it gradually.
